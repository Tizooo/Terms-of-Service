**1. Introduction**
These Terms of Service ("Terms", "ToS", "Policy") constitute a legal agreement between Leveling ("we", "us", "team") and you, the user. By using any of our services ("Service", "Product"), such as adding our Discord Bot to your server, you agree that you have read, understood, and accepted these Terms. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must have your legal guardian review and agree to these Terms to use our Service.

We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time, including adding, modifying, or removing provisions. If these changes affect your use of Leveling Products, we will notify you at least seven days before the changes take effect. Continued use of the Service after modifications to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of those changes.
